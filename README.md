## Dataset
- Name: 1000 Folk Stories Around the Globe
- Source: Kaggle (Public Dataset)
- Type: Text data (folk stories)

## Approach
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- NLP-based sentence importance scoring
- Extractive summarization

## Primary Artifact
The main evaluation artifact is the Jupyter Notebook:
`Smart_Cultural_Storyteller.ipynb`

## Output
Given a user-provided theme or description, the system:
- Identifies the most relevant folk story
- Produces a readable, meaningful summary

## Limitations
This project uses classical NLP techniques and does not employ large transformer-based language models.
